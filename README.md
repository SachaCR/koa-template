## About :

This repository is my personal template for building API with Koa.
You can use it for your own project if it suits your needs.

Don't hesitate to let me know if you appreciate it and to share it around you.

To see how i use it you can look some codes sample from the repository : `koa-template-samples`

## Create a project :

Clone this project and inside the repository run the `install.sh` script like this :
`./install.sh your-project-name`

This will create a new folder `your-project-name`

If you are on windows i dont think that the install script will work. So you can just download the repo as a .zip from github and use search and replace for `koa-template` and replace by your project name.

## Contributing :

- If you find a bug or have ideas to improve this template you can create an issue or a PR.
- If you have some ideas of code samples you can make a PR on `koa-template-samples`.
